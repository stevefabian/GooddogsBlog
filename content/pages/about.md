Gooddogs.com was started back in the mid to late 80's. I wanted a domain to use when
doing some side projects and consulting work, and at the time, my wife and I were
volunteering at an animal rescue shelter in Byram, NJ. We had 3 dogs at the time and 
over the years we've always had dogs in our family, as many as six at one time :)
