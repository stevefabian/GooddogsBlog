If, for any reason, you would like to contact me, the best way is by email. I do have a Twitter
handle, a Facebook page, an Instgram account, etc. but honestly, I rarely use them as I see
no need for anyone outside my immediate family to keep up to date with my activities

You can use the Social Icons in the footer to visit my social media sites, but as I said,
if you want a quick response, email is the best choice

<a href="mailto:steve@gooddogs.com" class="btn btn-primary">Email me</a>
